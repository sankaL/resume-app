# AI Resume Builder Build Plan

**Document status:** Active roadmap  
**Last updated:** 2026-04-19
**Implementation status:** Phases 0 through 4 implemented; Phase 5 in progress  
**Primary product source:** `docs/resume_builder_PRD_v3.md`  
**Database contract:** `docs/database_schema.md`

This roadmap now includes the committed Phase 0 foundation, the committed Phase 1 application-intake workflow, the committed Phase 1A blocked-site recovery plus Chrome extension intake follow-on, Phase 2 base resumes and profile preferences, Phase 3 generation/validation/assembly, and Phase 4 editing/regeneration/export. Phase 5 hardening and operations work is in progress.

## Planning Defaults

- Build the MVP as a private, invite-only product with authenticated access only.
- Keep all user data explicitly scoped by `user_id` and protected by Supabase RLS.
- Store all base resumes and generated drafts as Markdown.
- Keep `applied` separate from the primary application status.
- Treat `docs/database_schema.md` as the schema source of truth.
- Local development and testing must run through a Dockerized, Makefile-managed stack.
- Dev mode must use local Supabase services; production must connect to the hosted Supabase instance directly.
- Defer dedicated async job/progress tables until the background worker strategy is chosen during implementation.
- Keep a single current draft per application for MVP. No resume version-history UI or schema is planned.

### Bug Fixes

| Task ID | Task | Type | Status | Date updated | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B5-T38 | Accept wrapped structured bullets during generation sync and fail closed cleanly on cached-sync parse errors | BE | DONE | 2026-04-19 12:23:40 EDT | The shared resume render parser now accepts indented continuation lines inside structured Experience and Education bullets, preventing valid generated drafts from being rejected during generation callback sync, and terminal progress reconciliation now catches cached generation parse failures so application detail reads degrade into the existing sync-failure state instead of returning a transient 400. |
| B5-T37 | Preserve structured-draft Markdown fidelity and recover draft hydration after terminal-progress fallback | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-19 12:12:56 EDT | Structured resume normalization now preserves inline Markdown instead of flattening bullets and headers, legacy school-first education rows such as `MIT | MBA | 2022` keep their original school/degree order, and the detail page re-invalidates the draft when a newer live `resume_ready` detail arrives after an earlier polling-fallback completion path. |
| B5-T36 | Forward generation reasoning effort into the local agents container so Compose respects env overrides | Infra | DONE | 2026-04-19 11:58:34 EDT | `docker-compose.yml` now passes `GENERATION_AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT` into the `agents` service instead of silently falling back to the worker default `none`, and agents regression coverage now asserts both generation and Resume Judge reasoning-effort envs are wired through local Compose. |
| B5-T34 | Collapse generation-success recovery into a single queued Resume Judge update and consume cached success payloads atomically | BE | DONE | 2026-04-18 09:22:05 EDT | Railway production was exposing a race where terminal generation progress became visible before the backend had persisted the queued Resume Judge state, while concurrent detail/progress reads could replay the same cached generation success and enqueue duplicate judge runs. The backend now publishes `resume_ready` together with the queued judge state in one update and uses atomic cache consumption during callback-miss recovery so only one request can reconcile a cached success payload. |
| B5-T35 | Reduce detail-page live-update overfetch and immediately hydrate the generated draft after live completion | FE | DONE | 2026-04-19 11:49:03 EDT | The detail page now treats 5-second detail/progress polling as a stale-stream watchdog instead of always running alongside SSE, avoids re-fetching the current application after already applying a fresh response, and invalidates the draft query when a live `resume_ready` transition lands so the generated resume and Resume Judge card appear without a manual refresh. |
| B5-T33 | Replace detail-page polling with per-application SSE plus a 5-second watchdog fallback | FE/BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-17 22:10:54 EDT | Added an authenticated per-application SSE stream for extraction/generation/regeneration/judge updates, Redis-backed progress/detail event publishing, a fetch-based frontend stream hook that updates the shared query cache, and kept 5-second detail/progress watchdog polling for recovery and reconnect fallback. |
| B5-T32 | Keep the persisted generated draft visible across detail-page refreshes until regeneration completes | FE | DONE | 2026-04-17 22:15:00 EDT | The application detail page now always refetches any saved draft after the application shell loads, preserves the existing generated resume behind the in-flight generation or regeneration overlay instead of dropping to the empty state, and adds frontend regression coverage for refreshing into an active full-regeneration state. |
| B5-T31 | Preserve build-time frontend env fallbacks and stop query-cache regressions from clobbering profile, notes, and admin state | FE | DONE | 2026-04-17 21:33:43 EDT | Frontend runtime config now ignores unset runtime env overrides so production builds keep baked values, notes autosave no longer rehydrates the whole application detail form, admin-user mutations invalidate every cached filter variant, and the profile page now surfaces bootstrap failures instead of hanging behind a perpetual skeleton. |
| B5-T30 | Move the frontend to a production runtime, centralize shared query caching, and remove redundant shell/page overfetching | FE/BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-17 20:45:00 EDT | Replaced the Railway-facing frontend dev server with a production nginx runtime plus runtime-injected env config, added a shared React Query cache layer for bootstrap/applications/detail/base-resumes/admin/notifications, removed the shell-wide applications preload and notification event bus, extended bootstrap with aggregate application summary counts for shell badges, and added focused regression coverage for request counts plus notification invalidation behavior. |
| B5-T29 | Retry generation and Resume Judge without a reasoning payload when providers reject explicit `effort=\"none\"` as mandatory | AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-17 18:31:46 EDT | Extended reasoning-error detection to catch provider messages such as "reasoning is mandatory" and "cannot be disabled", so explicit `none` first attempts now downgrade to one same-model retry without the `reasoning` field before failing over. Added focused regression coverage and updated the prompt catalog. |
| B5-T28 | Send explicit OpenRouter `reasoning.effort=\"none\"` for generation and Resume Judge so non-reasoning runs do not inherit provider defaults | AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-17 18:31:46 EDT | Generation and Resume Judge now serialize `none` as an explicit OpenRouter reasoning payload instead of omitting the field, which prevents reasoning-capable models from silently using provider-default reasoning depth and timing out on otherwise valid requests. Added regression coverage and aligned the prompt catalog. |
| B5-T27 | Invalidate stale Resume Judge state across draft edits, job-detail changes, and generation-time base resume snapshots | AI/BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-17 12:40:07 EDT | Resume Judge now compares and persists the active job-context signature, ignores stale worker callbacks after job-detail edits, stores the generation-time base resume snapshot with each draft so grounding checks use the source that actually produced the draft, and keeps stale queued/running judge states out of the completed-score UI with added backend, worker, and frontend regression coverage. |
| B5-T26 | Move Resume Judge to the detail-page left rail and redesign the reviewer breakdown hierarchy | FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-17 14:15:00 EDT | Moved Resume Judge into a single dedicated left-rail card above Job Description for all draft states, removed the generated-resume header tile, redesigned the breakdown dialog with smaller summary hierarchy plus stacked expandable dimension rows, and added frontend regression coverage for pending, queued, failed, stale, and scored review flows. |
| B5-T25 | Align PRD with compare-first review flow for JD-driven additions | FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:50:07 EDT | Removed the regenerated warning-panel restoration so the detail page again relies on compare mode as the explicit MVP review path, updated regression coverage to keep the draft view free of the old `review_flags` card, and rewrote the PRD/decision log to describe compare as the required review workflow before apply/export. |
| B5-T24 | Restore generation-settings dirty tracking and generated-draft review-flag warnings | FE | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:44:35 EDT | Rebased generation-settings dirty detection on persisted draft/detail values so local page-length, aggressiveness, and instruction edits no longer mark themselves as already saved, restored the generated-draft `review_flags` warning card required for medium/high JD-only additions, and added regression coverage for both behaviors. |
| B5-T23 | Remove compare-mode diff highlighting and keep side-by-side resume preview plain | FE | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:24:42 EDT | Removed the generated-vs-base diff renderer and all compare highlight styling so both compare panes now use the same plain markdown preview, updated compare copy and regression coverage to assert no diff classes remain, and confirmed the remaining base-resume bullet issue is rooted in stored resume markdown quality rather than the preview component. |
| B5-T22 | Fix compare-mode markdown preview fidelity and align diff highlights to the spruce theme | FE | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:24:42 EDT | Restored plain `ReactMarkdown` rendering for standard/base-resume preview surfaces, moved generated-vs-base diff logic into a dedicated generated-preview renderer so headings and bullets no longer leak raw markdown syntax in compare mode, replaced the two-tone ember diff treatment with a single spruce highlight treatment, and made diff matching section-aware so reordered `##` sections such as Skills and Education no longer get flagged as wholly generated. |
| B5-T21 | Add immersive application-detail compare mode and inline generated-vs-base draft diff highlighting | FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:10:00 EDT | Removed the generated-workspace review-flags card, added shell-owned `default`/`immersive` layout mode so compare can hide the app sidebar and left rail without unmounting local form state, loaded the generation-time base resume via `draft.generation_params.base_resume_id` for a full-width generated-vs-base compare workspace, and extended Markdown preview rendering with block-aware inline diff highlighting plus failure-closed compare fallback coverage. |
| B5-T20 | Fix high-tailoring sparse-role validation, preserve draft review-flag provenance, and keep repair inside the remaining timeout budget | AI/BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-16 23:02:00 EDT | High-aggressiveness validation now allows a single rewritten bullet to satisfy the tailoring heuristic when only one checked source bullet exists, generation and regeneration persist the draft's source `base_resume_id` so review flags continue comparing against the resume that actually produced the draft even after settings change, and validation-repair attempts now consume only the remaining wall-clock budget inside the PRD timeout ceiling instead of starting a fresh repair window. |
| B5-T19 | Make generation and regeneration reasoning effort env-configurable | AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-16 22:38:50 EDT | Added env-backed `GENERATION_AGENT_REASONING_EFFORT` with validated values `none|low|medium|high|xhigh`, threaded it through generation and section regeneration for both primary and fallback attempts, kept repair non-reasoning, and set the tracked dotenv defaults to `none`. |
| B5-T18 | Make medium/high Professional Experience tailoring mandatory enough to visibly change bullets and grounded titles | AI/BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-16 22:20:00 EDT | Restored generation/regeneration reasoning defaults to `medium` while keeping repair non-reasoning, rewrote medium/high prompt contracts so Professional Experience is the primary tailoring surface with fixed role order, added deterministic heuristic validation for insufficient medium/high experience rewrites, passed that failure through the repair prompt, and expanded draft `review_flags` to catch JD-only Professional Experience title/header rewrites. |
| B5-T17 | Make medium/high tailoring materially different with JD keyword injection and explicit draft review flags | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-15 21:20:00 EDT | Updated generation prompt contracts so medium/high can inject job-description-driven non-factual keyword/skill phrasing, kept deterministic company/date/title invariants and fail-closed factual guardrails, added per-mode generation temperature tuning (`low=0.2`, `medium=0.35`, `high=0.5`), and exposed read-time draft `review_flags` in `GET /api/applications/{id}/draft` so medium/high JD-only additions are explicitly surfaced in the detail UI for user review. |
| B5-T16 | Bound generation retries, add validation-aware repair, enrich diagnostics, and surface blocked-start reasons | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-14 21:34:11 EDT | Generation and regeneration now use a bounded primary-structured then fallback-JSON pipeline with only reasoning-rejection downgrades on the same model, one repair-only pass after deterministic validation failure, richer sanitized attempt diagnostics across frontend/backend/worker flows, explicit frontend blocker messaging when generation never reaches the API, and generation defaults aligned to `openai/gpt-5-mini` primary plus `google/gemini-flash-1.5` fallback with `medium` reasoning for generation and regeneration. |
| B5-T15 | Add first-class DOCX export alongside shared export parsing and filename-aware downloads | BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-12 16:10:00 EDT | Export now supports both PDF and DOCX from the latest draft, with shared markdown normalization and section parsing, Word-native DOCX formatting on Letter pages, format-aware success/failure handling, and frontend downloads that honor the server-provided filename. |
| B5-T14 | Improve PDF export readability with smarter spacing, safer bullet parsing, and higher minimum fit presets | BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-12 12:32:05 EDT | PDF export now uses roomier header and section spacing, light document-density spacing adjustments, safer bullet-item rendering that unwraps accidental nested list markup without stripping literal `*` content, and a higher minimum readable preset floor of 9.4pt/1.10 line-height. Added regression coverage for spacing CSS, density classification, list rendering, and preset bounds. |
| B5-T14 | Remove redundant generation-start callback blocking and restore PRD timeout ceilings | BE/AI | DONE | 2026-04-14 12:50:17 EDT | Generation/regeneration workers no longer block on redundant `event=started` callback delivery before LLM work begins, internal callback retry overhead is reduced to limit queue stalls, and both worker and backend timeout ceilings are realigned to the PRD contract (`240s` full generation/full regeneration, `120s` section regeneration). Added regression coverage for the timeout contract. |
| B5-T13 | Recover generation/regeneration completions when worker callbacks are unreachable | BE/AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-11 14:34:00 EDT | Generation/regeneration workers now cache success payloads before callback delivery and treat callback transport as best-effort so transient backend connect failures no longer abort finished jobs; backend progress reconciliation can persist cached drafts when callbacks are missed and fails closed when no cache is available. |
| B5-T12 | Make application delete resilient to dependent-row schema drift in production | BE | DONE | 2026-04-11 13:43:53 EDT | `ApplicationRepository.delete_application()` now proactively clears dependent `resume_drafts`, `notifications`, `usage_events` (when present), and self-referencing duplicate links before deleting the application row, preventing foreign-key-related production delete 500s when historical schema constraints differ from current `ON DELETE` behavior. |
| B5-T11 | Prevent Redis progress-store outages from causing application delete 500s | BE | DONE | 2026-04-11 13:28:46 EDT | `ApplicationService.delete_application()` now treats Redis progress fetch/reconcile/delete as best-effort with warning logs, preserving active-state guardrails while allowing DB deletion to complete when cache infrastructure is transiently unavailable. Added regression coverage for progress-store get/delete failure paths. |
| B5-T10 | Reconcile terminal workflow progress before delete so stale active states do not block valid application deletion | BE | DONE | 2026-04-11 13:21:02 EDT | `ApplicationService.delete_application()` now applies terminal extraction/generation progress reconciliation before enforcing active-state delete guards, preventing callback-missed terminal states from causing false delete blocks. Added regression coverage for terminal extraction and terminal generation progress delete paths. |
| B5-T09 | Reduce extraction callback log noise for handled transport failures | AI/Observability | DONE | 2026-04-11 13:10:05 EDT | Worker callback delivery failures for extraction `started`/`failed`/`succeeded` events are now logged as warnings with concise error context instead of full exception stack traces, reducing false “job failed” signals while preserving non-fatal fallback behavior. |
| B5-T08 | Reconcile callback-missed extraction success on detail fetch and avoid false manual-entry fallback in UI | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-11 13:03:46 EDT | `GET /api/applications/{id}` now runs extraction terminal-progress reconciliation so detail fetch can recover callback-missed success without waiting on a separate progress poll, and the detail-page extraction fallback now maps terminal success progress to `generation_pending` instead of showing a false `manual_entry_required` error state. |
| B5-T07 | Recover callback-missed extraction success from Redis payload cache during progress polling | BE/AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-11 12:35:17 EDT | Worker now caches successful extraction payloads in Redis before callback delivery and backend progress reconciliation can apply that cached payload when callback transport fails, preventing callback outages from converting completed extraction into `manual_entry_required`. |
| B5-T06 | Harden extraction callback delivery so terminal callback outages do not abort completed work | BE/AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-11 12:19:02 EDT | Increased worker callback retry/backoff tolerance, made extraction failure callbacks non-fatal after terminal progress writes, and decoupled extraction success completion from callback delivery so callback transport outages no longer convert completed extraction into immediate runtime failure. |
| B5-T05 | Keep extraction jobs running when the initial worker callback cannot reach backend | BE/AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-11 12:06:57 EDT | Updated extraction orchestration so `event=started` callback delivery is best-effort instead of fatal, preventing early job aborts during transient backend network flaps while preserving progress-driven and terminal reconciliation fallback paths. |
| B5-T04 | Reconcile extraction terminal progress when worker callbacks are unreachable and surface manual-entry fallback immediately | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-11 11:41:24 EDT | Added backend extraction terminal-progress reconciliation from Redis so callback delivery failures fail closed into `manual_entry_required` (including blocked-source inference and callback-sync failure handling), and updated frontend extraction polling to switch into manual-entry recovery when terminal progress arrives but detail refresh fails or remains stuck in active extraction state. |
| B4-T26 | Normalize export typography so section headers, subheaders, and content use one consistent scale | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-19 14:18:00 EDT | Reworked the PDF and DOCX type scale so every section heading shares one size, all structured entry rows share one subheader size, and all body content across Summary, Skills, bullets, and other prose shares one smaller content size. Also increased spacing between sections and between adjacent experience and education entries. |
| B4-T25 | Align PDF and DOCX structured entry typography with the web preview hierarchy | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-19 14:05:00 EDT | Removed forced uppercase on company and school names in structured exports, capped structured row fonts below section-heading size, reduced body and bullet text relative to entry headers, and added more spacing between adjacent experience and education entries so print output matches the web preview more closely. |
| B4-T24 | Add a shared deterministic render model for experience and education across preview, PDF, and DOCX | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-19 13:30:00 EDT | Added a shared resume render/parser service, normalized structured Experience and Education blocks into a canonical two-row layout, exposed `render_model` on draft APIs, switched generated preview rendering to the semantic model, and aligned PDF/DOCX exports plus save-time validation around the same right-aligned metadata contract and readability spacing rules. |
| B5-T03 | Reduce full-regeneration timeout risk by lowering reasoning effort while keeping section regeneration high-reasoning | AI/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 15:03:36 EDT | Updated generation orchestration so initial generation and full regeneration use `medium` OpenRouter reasoning, while single-section regeneration stays on `high`; this preserves section-level depth but reduces full-regeneration timeout risk on slower models. Added regression coverage and updated prompt catalog docs accordingly. |
| B5-T02 | Enforce deterministic Professional Experience regeneration structure, longer generation timeouts, and full-regeneration caps | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 13:30:00 EDT | Added deterministic Professional Experience anchors plus normalization and contract validation so company/date cannot drift, moved generation timeout contracts to 240s full and 120s section with stage-based progress messaging, switched generation model defaults to `z-ai/glm-5.1` with `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` fallback, and enforced a non-admin cap of three full regenerations per application with admin bypass and contact-admin conflict guidance. |
| B5-T01 | Fail closed for admin invites when email delivery is disabled and surface Resend delivery failures | BE | DONE | 2026-04-10 11:52:07 EDT | Admin invite creation now blocks immediately when backend email notifications are disabled, and invite sends now record `invite_sent` failure metrics and return a clear actionable error when provider delivery fails instead of silently skipping email delivery. |
| B4-T23 | Add conditional section-spacing relief for one-page PDF readability | BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 10:30:10 EDT | One-page export validation now first attempts section-only spacing relief (section-to-section and heading-to-content separation) and keeps those readability gains only when the PDF still fits on one page. |
| B4-T22 | Improve one-page PDF page-fill efficiency with pre-export roominess validation | BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 10:18:18 EDT | Export now starts from larger density-first presets and, for `1_page` targets, validates roomier typography or spacing variants before finalizing so the PDF uses one page more evenly without spilling to page two. |
| B4-T21 | Rebalance one-page PDF fit density and emphasize Professional Experience role titles | BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 09:59:28 EDT | PDF export now uses a density-first preset ladder that tightens spacing before reducing font size, restores larger baseline readability when one-page content has room, and bolds only Professional Experience role-title split rows when the right column is a date range. |
| B4-T19 | Fix PDF export spacing and header replacement regressions, and warn more clearly about high aggressiveness | BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 22:08:23 EDT | PDF export now keeps typography-derived spacing in physical print units instead of oversized `rem` values, export normalization replaces plain-text profile headers instead of duplicating them, and the Generation Settings UI plus PRD now warn more explicitly that High aggressiveness can make substantial changes and should be reviewed carefully. |
| B4-T20 | Tighten PDF export vertical spacing and extend autofit compression for true one-page outputs | BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 22:19:08 EDT | The export renderer now removes most top margins between stacked blocks, eliminates extra first-section offset, tightens list and split-row spacing, and adds deeper fallback presets with smaller print margins so one-page resumes are more likely to stay on a single actual PDF page. |
| B4-T18 | Fix profile PATCH JSONB binding and add sanitized diagnostics for profile-save failures | BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 21:29:34 EDT | `profiles.update_profile()` now wraps `section_preferences` and `section_order` values with psycopg `Jsonb` before `%s::jsonb` updates, preventing 500s when saving profile/preferences; the profile API now logs only exception class and attempted update field names on failure, and backend regression tests cover both JSONB wrapping and sanitized error logging. |
| B4-T17 | Increase base resume Markdown editor height to use 50% of viewport for easier long-form editing | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:16:19 EDT | Updated base resume editor textareas in upload-review, blank-create, and existing-edit flows from `min-h-[500px]` to `min-h-[50vh]` so the Markdown editor uses more vertical screen space and reduces scrolling while editing. |
| B4-T16 | Fix dashboard monthly analytics labeling and aggregate low-volume job sources consistently | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 10:32:47 EDT | The dashboard monthly chart now labels the second series as applications created in that month that are currently marked applied, and the job-sources card now rolls excess origins into an `Other` bucket so the list, percentages, pie slices, and total stay consistent. |
| B4-T15 | Block generation and regeneration when stored job data is a blocked-source placeholder | BE | DONE | 2026-04-08 20:06:08 EDT | Generation, full regeneration, and section regeneration now fail closed before queueing if the stored job title or description still looks like blocked-page placeholder text, moving the application back to `manual_entry_required` with blocked-source diagnostics and an action-required recovery notification instead of sending bad input to the LLM. |
| B4-T14 | Align full-draft generation timeouts with the PRD and preserve timeout failures through model fallback | AI/BE | DONE | 2026-04-08 19:54:26 EDT | Full generation and full regeneration now use a `90s` per-attempt LLM timeout instead of the section-level `45s` limit, single-section regeneration remains at `45s`, and provider timeouts now propagate as timeout-classified failures so the worker can surface `generation_timeout` or `regeneration_timeout` instead of a generic unexpected error. |
| B4-T13 | Fix dashboard load failures, shared-table paging/sort regressions, and stale shell application state after detail mutations | FE | DONE | 2026-04-08 16:17:58 EDT | Dashboard load errors now render a recovery state instead of the empty workspace, the shared data table clamps page state and applies sortable header ordering, and detail-page mutations plus terminal polling refresh the shell application cache so breadcrumbs and attention badges stay current. |
| B4-T12 | Tighten multi-line instruction screening and align low-aggressiveness length rules with minimal-change behavior | AI/BE | DONE | 2026-04-08 14:05:00 EDT | Generation instruction screening now normalizes textarea whitespace before policy checks, still blocks newline-separated override or fact-injection attempts, allows grounded title or company emphasis requests, and low aggressiveness no longer applies pruning-oriented bullet or skills caps that conflict with its preserve-the-source contract. |
| B4-T11 | Emit generation heartbeats during long reasoning calls so idle-timeout recovery does not fire on healthy runs | AI/BE | DONE | 2026-04-08 13:35:00 EDT | Full generation and full regeneration now emit periodic in-flight progress heartbeats while waiting on structured-output model calls, preventing the 90-second idle timeout from marking healthy long-running reasoning requests as stalled. |
| B4-T10 | Redesign prompts, enable generation-only OpenRouter reasoning, and add upload review warnings | AI/BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-08 12:55:00 EDT | Resume generation now uses expert resume-writer prompts with section-specific aggressiveness and word budgets, generation-only reasoning through OpenRouter with structured-output fallback, stricter instruction validation, draft-context-aware section regeneration, extraction prompt hardening, and upload cleanup review warnings surfaced in the UI. |
| B4-T09 | Fix review regressions in fallback retry, grounding validation, and privacy sanitization | AI/BE | DONE | 2026-04-08 09:59:29 EDT | Fallback retry now resumes on schema-invalid model output, deterministic validation now checks unsupported role, employer, and credential claims in generated prose, markdown `# Name` headers are sanitized correctly, and upload cleanup no longer strips substantive project or publication URL lines from resume bodies. |
| B4-T08 | Allow grounded list-style supporting snippets without requiring exact contiguous source order | AI | DONE | 2026-04-08 09:35:16 EDT | Deterministic validation now accepts list-like skill snippets when their individual grounded terms exist in the sanitized source, avoiding false failures for shortened or reordered excerpts such as `SQL, Python, Java` or `Azure DevOps, CI/CD, Jenkins`. |
| B4-T07 | Make resume assembly null-safe for legacy or incomplete profile fields | AI | DONE | 2026-04-08 09:30:25 EDT | Assembly now coerces nullable personal-info fields to empty strings instead of calling `.strip()` on `None`, so existing applications with incomplete profile data no longer crash after a valid one-call generation response. |
| B4-T06 | Treat recoverable structured-output issues as local normalization instead of fallback-model retries | AI | DONE | 2026-04-08 09:24:20 EDT | Generation now truncates oversized `supporting_snippets` lists locally, explicitly asks for 1-6 snippets in the prompt, and only retries the fallback model on provider failures or unparseable JSON rather than on deterministic schema-validation issues. |
| B4-T05 | Normalize equivalent LLM JSON section shapes before schema validation so generation does not fail on wrapper differences | AI | DONE | 2026-04-08 09:14:40 EDT | The generation parser now accepts canonical `sections` arrays, `sections` maps, root-level section maps, and bare single-section payloads, normalizes them locally, and only falls back when the output is still structurally invalid after normalization. |
| B4-T03 | Fix JSONB application updates so terminal generation recovery can persist failure details | BE | DONE | 2026-04-07 23:19:59 EDT | `applications.update_application()` now wraps JSONB fields correctly for psycopg, allowing timeout and terminal-progress reconciliation paths to persist `generation_failure_details`, `extraction_failure_details`, and duplicate match metadata without 500s. |
| B4-T04 | Stop multi-call resume generation, keep contact data out of LLM prompts, and harden generation callbacks | BE/FE/AI | DONE | 2026-04-08 08:39:33 EDT | Resume writing now uses one structured LLM call per action, sanitizes contact/header data before external calls, reattaches it locally, retries callbacks with backoff, fences stale worker progress, and hydrates saved generation settings back into regeneration UX. |
| B4-T02 | Stop infinite generation polling loops and make full-generation timeout progress-aware | BE/FE/AI | DONE | 2026-04-07 23:07:06 EDT | Full generation now times out on stalled progress instead of a blunt 90-second wall-clock, stalled-job recovery runs from the progress endpoint, and the detail page stops polling after terminal progress even if the final detail refresh fails. |
| B4-T01 | Fix generation callback contract, active-state handling, and cancel or timeout failure compatibility | BE/FE/AI | DONE | 2026-04-07 22:45:00 EDT | Worker callbacks now match the backend payload contract, generation timeout and cancellation failure reasons are schema-safe, stale callbacks are fenced off after cancel or timeout, and the detail page no longer treats failed `generation_pending` rows as active jobs. |
| B1A-T01 | Persist extracted reference IDs from worker success callbacks and use them in duplicate detection | BE | DONE | 2026-04-07 15:51:23 EDT | Added `applications.extracted_reference_id`, persisted worker-extracted IDs, and updated duplicate detection to use the stored value before falling back to URL or description parsing. |
| B1A-T02 | Restore fail-closed application-state transitions and tighten Chrome extension bridge trust checks | BE/FE | DONE | 2026-04-07 16:02:40 EDT | Manual-entry PATCH edits no longer clear recovery state, duplicate resolution now requires a pending duplicate-review state, retry queue failures restore manual-entry progress/notifications, and the Chrome extension now accepts bridge messages only from trusted local or already-connected app origins. |

| Task ID | Task | Type | Status | Date updated | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A0-T31 | Fix Resume Judge rerun card nullability so Railway frontend builds pass | FE | DONE | 2026-04-18 08:50:37 EDT | Replaced the non-narrowed `resumeJudge.message` access in the max-attempts branch with an explicit nullable-safe read so `tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json` no longer fails during the Railway frontend build. |
| A0-T30 | Cap Resume Judge reruns and harden Railway callback delivery | AI/BE/FE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-18 08:17:15 EDT | Added a three-run per-draft Resume Judge cap with persisted `run_attempt_count`, disabled stale retry loops in the detail UI after the third failed run, and hardened worker callback delivery to fall back from the stale Railway internal `:8000` backend URL to Railway-safe backend candidates after confirming production `agents` was misconfigured. |
| A0-T29 | Fix Railway frontend builds by bundling the workflow contract inside the frontend service | FE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-17 22:33:08 EDT | Replaced the frontend's `@shared/workflow-contract.json` dependency with a frontend-bundled contract file and removed the stale shared-path aliases, so isolated Docker and Railway frontend builds no longer depend on repo-root files outside the frontend service context. |
| A0-T28 | Restore visible list bullets in shared resume preview rendering | FE | DONE | 2026-04-17 12:23:31 EDT | Updated the shared `MarkdownPreview` renderer to emit explicit unordered and ordered list marker classes instead of relying on ambient CSS defaults, which restores visible bullets in generated-draft preview and base-resume compare preview, and added focused regression coverage for the list-rendering contract. |
| A0-T27 | Tighten generated-resume preview controls into a stable top-right header and compare layout | FE | DONE | 2026-04-17 12:17:43 EDT | Moved preview/edit, compare, and regeneration controls into one consistent top-right header row, kept regeneration as a dropdown while restoring the original green gradient icon button treatment, converted generated and base resume metadata into muted chips, removed the redundant compare helper copy, tightened header-to-content spacing, and removed the inner preview frame so both compare panes read more like pages. |
| A0-T26 | Strengthen aggressiveness prompt differentiation, bounded title rewrites, and anti-filler voice rules | AI/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-13 23:05:11 EDT | Low now keeps Professional Experience titles source-exact, medium allows only grounded title reframing with the same role family and seniority plus explicit bullet consolidation, high allows bounded inference plus more flexible role reframing while preserving company/date invariants, and the prompts/docs now include explicit anti-filler voice guidance, a dedicated high-inference worked example that appears only in high-mode prompts, and a note that medium title-family validation is only heuristic. |
| A0-T27 | Fix frontend runtime env script generation so production config loads without syntax errors | FE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-18 07:52:47 EDT | Removed the leading-comma bug in `frontend/docker-entrypoint.sh` when writing `env-config.js`, redeployed the `frontend` Railway service from `frontend/`, and verified live `env-config.js` now parses correctly with populated `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `VITE_API_URL`. |
| A0-T28 | Apply missing production Resume Judge schema migration to restore applications API reads | BE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-18 07:56:24 EDT | Applied the additive `applications.resume_judge_result jsonb` migration directly to production Postgres so backend `/api/applications` queries stopped failing with `UndefinedColumn`, then verified Railway HTTP logs returned `GET /api/applications 200`. |
| A0-T25 | Fix production session bootstrap failures by correcting workflow contract path resolution in backend containers | BE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-11 09:59:40 EDT | Bundled `workflow-contract.json` inside `backend/app/core`, pointed backend contract loading to that packaged path by default, and kept repo-root fallbacks for local workflows, eliminating `/shared/workflow-contract.json` file-not-found crashes on `/api/session/bootstrap`. |
| A0-T25 | Restore Railway production availability by fixing frontend port routing and agents Redis config | Infra/Ops | DONE | 2026-04-18 07:45:36 EDT | Added missing production `REDIS_URL=redis://redis.railway.internal:6379/0` to `agents` so the ARQ worker stopped crash-looping on `localhost`, and set frontend `PORT=5173` to match the Railway domain target port so `frontend-production-b75c3.up.railway.app`, `applix.ca`, and `/app/applications` returned `200 OK` again. |
| A0-T24 | Seed admin invite account in production and issue signup token link | BE/Infra/Ops | DONE | 2026-04-11 09:46:29 EDT | Provisioned `sanka.lokuliyana@gmail.com` in Supabase Auth, forced `profiles.is_admin=true` and `is_active=true`, revoked stale pending invites, created a fresh pending invite token, and validated the public invite-preview endpoint resolves the token. |
| A0-T23 | Fix Railway runtime routing by binding backend to `$PORT` and allowing custom frontend domain host checks | FE/BE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-11 09:26:27 EDT | Updated backend Docker CMD to bind Uvicorn to `PORT` (fallback `8000`) for Railway edge routing, and added `applix.ca` to Vite `server.allowedHosts` plus `preview.allowedHosts` so the custom frontend domain is not blocked. |
| A0-T22 | Fix Railway worker Redis connectivity by wiring service-to-service `REDIS_URL` in production | Infra | DONE | 2026-04-10 17:29:08 EDT | Set `REDIS_URL=redis://redis.railway.internal:6379/0` on both `agents` and `backend`, then redeployed services so ARQ worker no longer attempts localhost and connects to Railway Redis successfully. |
| A0-T21 | Allow Railway generated frontend hostnames in Vite to unblock production access | FE/Infra | DONE | 2026-04-10 17:24:29 EDT | Added `.up.railway.app` to Vite `server.allowedHosts` and `preview.allowedHosts`, then deployed frontend so Railway host-check no longer blocks `frontend-production-*.up.railway.app`. |
| A0-T20 | Wire push-to-main selective Railway deploys via GitHub Actions so only changed services redeploy | Infra/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-10 17:00:08 EDT | Created Railway project `job-app-prod` with `backend` and `frontend` services, added `.github/workflows/deploy-railway-main.yml` path-filtered deploy automation, and configured GitHub secrets for project/service IDs plus a dedicated Railway project token. |
| A0-T23 | Reorganize the prompt catalog into a mode-first resume-generation reference with shared deterministic rules | Docs | DONE | 2026-04-13 11:30:00 EDT | Reworked `docs/prompts.md` so resume generation and regeneration are grouped by shared logic plus low, medium, and high modes, including the live full-draft and section-regeneration prompt text, operation differences, target-length contracts, instruction filtering, validation rules, and deterministic Professional Experience invariants. |
| A0-T19 | Add semantic job-location extraction alongside compensation and expose it in the detail workspace | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:56:55 EDT | Extraction now persists optional raw `job_location_text` separately from `compensation_text`, the prompt contract requires semantic separation even when both appear on the same rendered line, the detail workspace exposes Location for review and editing, and duplicate-review behavior remains unchanged when only location text changes. |
| A0-T18 | Make Markdown edit mode visually structured with highlighted headers in both resume editors | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:42:10 EDT | Added a shared highlighted Markdown editor that keeps plain Markdown as the saved value, color-codes and bolds `#`, `##`, and `###` lines while editing, and wired it into both base-resume editing and application draft edit mode. |
| A0-T17 | Replace inline new-application intake with a modal and allow optional pasted-text creation | FE/BE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:22:31 EDT | The applications page now opens a URL-first modal instead of an inline card, reveals pasted job text only when the user asks for it, and extends `POST /api/applications` so URL plus pasted source text can create and queue extraction directly from the modal. |
| A0-T17 | Fix resume export header duplication, add profile LinkedIn support, and tighten PDF page-fit behavior | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:18:29 EDT | Resume assembly and export now use one profile-driven header with location plus LinkedIn support, initial generation and full regeneration or export fail closed when profile `name` is missing, and PDF export retries tighter WeasyPrint presets to better match the saved `page_length` target. |
| A0-T16 | Allow high-aggressiveness professional-experience title rewrites while keeping low and medium title-fixed | AI/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 20:00:24 EDT | High aggressiveness now allows truthful role-title rewrites inside Professional Experience only, low and medium explicitly keep source role titles unchanged, the validator honors that high-only carveout, and the settings UI plus prompt catalog explain the rule clearly. |
| A0-T15 | Capture full posting text plus compensation and clarify aggressiveness settings in the detail workspace | AI/BE/FE/Docs | DONE | 2026-04-09 19:36:58 EDT | Extraction now stores the full primary posting body instead of a narrowed responsibilities excerpt, applications can persist optional raw `compensation_text`, the detail workspace exposes that field for review and editing, and the compact Generation Settings card now uses inline popovers to explain exactly what low, medium, and high will change. |
| A0-T14 | Keep attention-required notifications pinned when using inbox clear-all | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 19:17:57 EDT | Refined inbox clear-all so it deletes only non-action-required notifications, keeps attention items visible until the underlying issue is resolved, and updated backend plus frontend regression coverage to reflect the pinned-attention behavior. |
| A0-T13 | Refresh open application views after inbox clear and keep popup branding assets inside the extension root | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 14:28:00 EDT | Clear-all inbox now broadcasts a frontend refresh event so the applications list and detail page immediately drop stale action-required UI, and the Chrome extension popup now loads its logo from an asset bundled inside `frontend/public/chrome-extension/` with regression coverage for both fixes. |
| A0-T12 | Align resume delete affordances with the shared icon-only destructive action pattern | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 14:18:43 EDT | Replaced resume-card and resume-detail text delete buttons with the shared icon-only delete control, swapped browser confirms for the shared confirmation modal, and kept the existing resume delete flow plus regression coverage intact. |
| A0-T11 | Add clear-all inbox controls for top-bar notifications | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 14:15:55 EDT | Added a user-scoped clear-all notifications endpoint, wired a `Clear all` action into the top-bar inbox dropdown, refreshed shell attention state after clearing, and added backend plus frontend regression coverage for success and failure handling. |
| A0-T10 | Turn the top-bar notification bell into a scrollable inbox dropdown with linked application navigation | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 14:04:05 EDT | Added a user-scoped notifications inbox API, converted the bell into a dropdown that fetches newest-first notifications on open, keeps the existing attention badge semantics, scrolls for long lists, and routes linked notifications directly to their application detail page with frontend and backend regression coverage. |
| A0-T09 | Rebrand the user-facing app and extension surfaces to Applix with the new folder logo | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 14:00:11 EDT | Added the supplied folder logo as the canonical public asset, replaced login/sidebar/browser/extension branding with Applix, and updated user-facing backend email subjects plus the exposed API title while leaving internal bridge identifiers unchanged. |
| A0-T08 | Add icon-based application delete controls and user-triggered extraction stop recovery | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 13:59:38 EDT | Added icon-only delete controls in the applications table and detail header, introduced authenticated extraction-stop recovery with stale-callback fencing and no action-required notification, and updated the detail recovery UI so stuck extraction rows can be stopped, retried, or deleted safely. |
| A0-T06 | Rebuild the dashboard analytics layout around a full-width monthly activity area chart and compact quarter-row summary cards | FE | DONE | 2026-04-09 09:44:31 EDT | Dashboard analytics now place a full-width monthly activity card directly below the KPI row, render the yearly created-versus-applied trend with a `recharts` area chart and shared chart UI wrapper, convert job sources into a compact pie chart, and rebalance job sources, top companies, and status breakdown into a responsive equal-width row. |
| A0-T05 | Redesign the invite-only login page into a full-bleed branded auth surface with illustration-led composition | FE | DONE | 2026-04-08 22:18:41 EDT | Replaced the boxed login card with a full-viewport split layout, reused the existing Resume Builder / AI Workspace branding and theme fonts, added the businessman illustration as a frontend-served asset, and kept the existing auth flow, dev-mode messaging, and MVP signup restrictions intact. |
| A0-T07 | Add application-table delete, bulk apply or delete selection, and row-alignment fixes | FE/BE | DONE | 2026-04-09 09:25:55 EDT | Added user-scoped application deletion with active-work blocking and progress cleanup, introduced current-page selection with bulk mark-as-applied and bulk delete actions in the applications table, and top-aligned the compact row layout so status badges and row text share the same visual baseline. |
| A0-T04 | Tighten dashboard, applications, resumes, and extension UI density while normalizing status affordances | FE | DONE | 2026-04-08 22:16:10 EDT | Added compact card density primitives, normalized status badge sizing, unified the applied toggle treatment, stabilized application row heights with truncation, moved detail-page PDF export into the header action cluster, refreshed dashboard analytics visuals, added resume search, and tightened card spacing across the main frontend surfaces. |
| A0-T03 | Rework the authenticated frontend shell and primary pages to use a fluid full-width responsive layout | FE | DONE | 2026-04-08 21:14:34 EDT | Removed the authenticated shell max-width cap, added shared responsive gutters, expanded list and card layouts to use wide screens more effectively, and converted the application detail workspace to a responsive grid with a compact sticky settings rail and independent resume pane scrolling. |
| A0-T02 | Document the latest live prompt catalog and variant permutations under `docs/prompts.md` | Docs | DONE | 2026-04-08 10:00:39 EDT | Added a code-derived prompt catalog covering extraction, resume generation, section regeneration, and upload cleanup, including the current prompt text, variant matrix, and dynamic section-permutation rules. |
| A0-T01 | Simplify the local env contract, disable local auth emails, and add the backend Resend send gate | Infra | DONE | 2026-04-07 12:06:48 EDT | Root env is now canonical, local GoTrue mail delivery is disabled, and backend email sending is gated by `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED`. |

## Phase 0 — Foundation, Containerization, Auth Boundary, and Schema

**Scope**

- Scaffold the committed stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + `shadcn`, FastAPI, Supabase, and prompt-layer assets under `agents/`.
- Dockerize the local development stack with separate containers for frontend, backend, agents, and local Supabase services.
- Add a dedicated dev-mode environment switch that points the app at the local Dockerized stack for testing and keeps production on the hosted Supabase instance.
- Implement the invite-only login surface with Supabase email/password auth.
- Establish protected frontend routes and a protected backend API boundary.
- Create the initial Postgres schema, enums, and RLS policies from `docs/database_schema.md`.
- Centralize the PRD status vocabulary so frontend, backend, and background work use the same visible statuses, internal states, and failure reasons.
- Add a repository-level Makefile as the single entrypoint for local development and testing workflows.

**Dependencies**

- `docs/resume_builder_PRD_v3.md`
- `docs/database_schema.md`

**Decision Gates**

- Select the background job strategy with persistence appropriate for Railway.
- Select the real-time progress delivery model for long-running extraction and generation work.
- Confirm the OpenRouter primary/fallback model integration path through LangChain.
- Decide whether the local Supabase stack is managed via the official Supabase CLI containers or an equivalent Docker Compose orchestration owned by the repo.

**Deliverables**

- Protected app shell and authenticated session flow.
- Backend auth middleware and per-request user resolution from Supabase JWTs.
- Initial database migration set with RLS enabled on all user-scoped tables.
- Shared status constants/types used across frontend and backend.
- Docker assets for the frontend container, backend container, agents container, and local Supabase-backed dev stack.
- A Makefile with the local development and test orchestration targets required to boot, stop, reset, and verify the Dockerized stack from one entrypoint.
- Local scripts referenced by the Makefile for repeatable container startup, teardown, health checking, and local test preparation where those flows would otherwise become ad-hoc shell commands.

**Exit Criteria**

- An invited user can authenticate and reach protected application routes.
- Unauthenticated requests are rejected everywhere except the login surface.
- No auth tokens are stored in browser `localStorage`.
- All user tables exist with owner-scoped RLS policies.
- A developer can start the full local stack through the Makefile and get frontend, backend, agents, and local Supabase services running together.
- Local dev mode does not connect to production Supabase Auth or the production Supabase database.
- Production configuration is documented to use the hosted Supabase instance directly rather than local containers.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Log in to an invite-only app with email and password.

**Phase 0 Local Stack Requirements**

- Frontend runs in its own container.
- Backend runs in its own container.
- Agents orchestration runs in its own container.
- Local Supabase services run in Docker for development and test environments only.
- The Makefile is the source of truth for local stack lifecycle tasks instead of ad-hoc startup commands.
- The Makefile should cover, at minimum, stack boot, stack shutdown, stack reset, logs, health verification, and local test preparation tasks.

## Phase 1 — Application Intake, Extraction, and Duplicate Review

**Scope**

- Build the applications dashboard with loading, empty-state, search, filter, sort, and inline `applied` toggle support.
- Implement the New Application flow as a URL-first intake with optional pasted-text submission.
- Create draft applications immediately, then launch async job extraction with progress feedback.
- Support extraction success, extraction failure, retry extraction, and manual entry fallback, including normalized job posting origin capture.
- Allow job posting origin to be auto-populated when extractable, edited later from the application detail view, and manually selected during manual entry.
- Run duplicate detection after extraction success or manual entry completion, using job posting origin when it is available.
- Persist duplicate warning details, show the matching application link, and allow permanent dismissal for the new application.

**Dependencies**

- Phase 0 auth boundary and schema
- Background worker baseline from Phase 0

**Decision Gates**

- Confirm Playwright packaging and runtime behavior on Railway.
- Set the configurable duplicate threshold and candidate-selection approach around `rapidfuzz`.

**Deliverables**

- Dashboard list and detail navigation for applications.
- Application creation endpoint and extraction job orchestration.
- Manual entry form and retry extraction control, including the job posting origin dropdown and conditional `Other` label.
- Duplicate warning UI with persisted resolution state.
- In-app and email notifications for extraction problems, including manual-entry-required cases.

**Exit Criteria**

- A user can create a new application from a job link.
- Extraction either populates the application or routes the user into a recoverable manual-entry path.
- Job posting origin is saved automatically when extractable and can be added or corrected manually without breaking the workflow.
- Duplicate review blocks generation until resolved or dismissed.
- Dashboard badges reflect unresolved duplicate and action-required states.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Create a new application from a job link.
- Receive automatic extraction or be routed to manual entry on failure.
- Capture job posting origin automatically when possible and allow manual selection later when needed.
- See duplicate overlap warnings with similarity score, matched fields, and a link to the existing application.
- Dismiss a duplicate warning permanently.

## Phase 1A — Blocked-Page Recovery and Chrome Extension Intake

**Scope**

- Detect blocked pages explicitly before LLM extraction and persist sanitized blocked-source diagnostics on the application.
- Add pasted-text recovery so extraction can rerun from user-supplied source content before the user falls back to manual entry.
- Extend the application detail page with blocked-source recovery messaging, diagnostics, pasted-text retry, and the existing manual fallback.
- Add scoped Chrome extension token bootstrap, revoke, and token-protected import endpoints.
- Ship a Chrome Manifest V3 extension that captures the current tab and creates a new application in the authenticated app.

**Dependencies**

- Phase 1 application intake, progress polling, worker callback, and manual-entry baseline
- Existing user-scoped auth and notifications contracts from Phase 0 and Phase 1

**Deliverables**

- Additive schema migration for `applications.extraction_failure_details` and revocable extension-token fields on `profiles`.
- Worker blocked-page detection for Indeed- and Cloudflare-style block signals, including sanitized reference-ID extraction.
- Authenticated pasted-text recovery endpoint plus frontend recovery form on the application detail page.
- Chrome extension onboarding route in the app and a load-unpacked MV3 extension bundle under `frontend/public/chrome-extension/`.

**Exit Criteria**

- Blocked pages route the application into `manual_entry_required` with sanitized diagnostics and active attention state.
- Pasted-text recovery can rerun extraction and clear stale blocked-failure state on success.
- Revoking an extension token invalidates further extension imports immediately.
- Chrome current-tab capture can create a new application and open the detail page without using Supabase session tokens in the extension.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Create a new application from a connected Chrome current-tab capture.
- Receive blocked-source recovery with provider, reference ID, blocked URL, and pasted-text retry before manual entry.

## Phase 2 — Base Resumes, Profile, Preferences, and Generation Setup

**Scope**

- Build base resume creation, editing, deletion, and default selection flows.
- Support base resume creation from file upload and structured form input.
- Persist and edit user personal information needed for assembly and export.
- Persist section enablement preferences and section order preferences.
- Implement the pre-generation configuration surface for target length, aggressiveness, additional instructions, and base resume selection.

**Dependencies**

- Phase 0 schema and auth
- Phase 1 application detail and duplicate resolution path

**Decision Gates**

- Confirm the document-ingestion path for `.docx` and `.pdf` conversion to Markdown.
- Decide whether an optional LLM cleanup pass is needed after file parsing.

**Deliverables**

- Base resume CRUD APIs and screens.
- Resume upload parsing pipeline and structured form assembler to Markdown.
- User profile and section-preferences screens.
- Generation setup form with default-base-resume behavior.

**Exit Criteria**

- A user can manage one or more base resumes.
- A user can set and change a default base resume.
- Personal information can be stored without LLM generation.
- Section preferences affect future generations only unless the user explicitly regenerates.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Manage base resumes (create via file upload or form, edit, delete, set default).
- Select a base resume and generation settings before generating.

## Phase 3 — Generation, Validation, Assembly, Notifications, and Workspace

**Scope**

- Build the application detail page as the main resume workspace.
- Implement structured single-call resume generation through LangChain and OpenRouter.
- Run deterministic schema and rule validation over generated output before assembly.
- Assemble final Markdown by injecting profile personal information and ordered enabled sections.
- Save the current draft, update statuses, and create the required in-app and email notifications.
- Render generated Markdown in preview mode and keep the `applied` flag independent from the visible status.

**Dependencies**

- Phase 2 base resume content and user profile data
- Phase 0 shared status contracts and background job foundation

**Decision Gates**

- Confirm the Markdown rendering library for the frontend preview mode.
- Lock the structured JSON contract used between prompt assets and backend orchestration.

**Deliverables**

- Single-call generation service with configurable primary and fallback models.
- Deterministic validation service enforcing schema compliance, grounding, section presence, order, ATS-safety, and contact-data exclusion.
- Resume assembly path writing `resume_drafts`.
- Application detail page with status badge, job info, notifications, preview mode, and `applied` toggle behavior.

**Exit Criteria**

- A user can generate an ATS-friendly Markdown resume from a selected base resume and job posting.
- Validation failures leave a recoverable `Needs Action` state with notifications.
- Successful generation lands the application in `Needs Action` (ready for review).
- The preview mode reflects the latest saved Markdown draft.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Generate an ATS-friendly Markdown resume via LangChain + OpenRouter.
- View the resume in rendered preview mode.
- Toggle the Applied flag independently of the primary status.
- Receive in-app notifications for workflow events.
- Receive email notifications for high-signal generation events.

## Phase 4 — Editing, Regeneration, and PDF Export

**Scope**

- Implement Markdown edit mode with persistent save behavior.
- Support single-section regeneration with required instructions.
- Support full regeneration with pre-filled prior settings and overwrite of the current draft.
- Implement on-demand PDF and DOCX export from the latest draft content with ATS-safe formatting.
- Preserve the PRD rule that editing or regenerating after export returns the visible status to `Needs Action` (resume ready but export stale).
- Handle regeneration and export failures with recoverable status changes and notifications.

**Dependencies**

- Phase 3 generation, validation, and draft persistence

**Decision Gates**

- Select the PDF rendering engine and validate ATS-safe output quality.

**Deliverables**

- Markdown editor mode and preview/edit mode switch.
- Section regeneration endpoint with deterministic validation.
- Full regeneration path that overwrites the current draft and updates timestamps.
- Export endpoints that stream generated PDF or DOCX files without storing them.
- In-app notifications for export success and failure, plus email notifications for export failures.

**Exit Criteria**

- A user can edit and save Markdown directly.
- Section regeneration rejects blank instructions and updates only the selected section.
- Full regeneration reuses and updates prior settings appropriately.
- Export produces a fresh PDF or DOCX file from the latest saved draft and does not persist the file.
- Editing or regeneration after export returns the application to `Needs Action`.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- Edit the resume in plain Markdown mode and save.
- Regenerate a single section with required instructions.
- Regenerate the full resume with updated settings and optional instructions.
- Export the current draft as a PDF or DOCX download.
- See status return to `Needs Action` after editing or regenerating a previously exported resume.

## Phase 5 — Hardening, Recovery, and MVP Acceptance

**Scope**

- Add timeout boundaries, bounded retries, stop conditions, and cleanup behavior for all async flows.
- Verify failure recovery paths for extraction, manual entry, generation, regeneration, and export.
- Add regression coverage where test surfaces exist for status mapping, user scoping, duplicate dismissal, and export freshness.
- Validate that logging stays structured and sanitized.
- Run an end-to-end acceptance sweep against the PRD and keep product and schema docs aligned.

**Dependencies**

- Phases 0 through 4

**Decision Gates**

- None should remain open at phase entry; unresolved findings become release blockers.

**Deliverables**

- Timeout and retry implementations for extraction, generation, regeneration, and export.
- Regression and integration coverage for core workflow paths.
- A release-readiness checklist tied to PRD acceptance criteria.
- Updated rollout and migration guidance when real schema migrations land.

**Exit Criteria**

- All timeout contracts from the PRD are enforced.
- All recoverable failure states surface clear user next steps.
- All PRD acceptance criteria have a passing implementation path.
- Documentation remains aligned across PRD, schema, and migration runbook.

**PRD Acceptance Coverage**

- All MVP acceptance criteria must pass at least one automated or manual verification path before release.

## Notes for Future Task Updates

- Update each phase status and this document timestamp as implementation progresses.
- When a task changes schema, rollout order, compatibility, backfills, or post-deploy checks, update `docs/backend-database-migration-runbook.md` in the same task.
- Keep `docs/database_schema.md` and `docs/resume_builder_PRD_v3.md` aligned whenever status models, data contracts, or workflow behavior changes.
