# Decisions Made

## 2026-04-10 17:00:08 EDT — Use GitHub Actions path-filtered Railway CLI deploys for selective push-to-main releases

- Status: Accepted
- Context: The repo did not have deployment automation from `main` to Railway, and the requirement was to redeploy only services whose code changed (for example backend-only changes should not redeploy frontend).
- Decision:
  1. Create a dedicated Railway project `job-app-prod` with separate `backend` and `frontend` services and keep deploy targeting service-specific IDs.
  2. Add a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-railway-main.yml`) on `push` to `main` that uses path filters to compute changed services.
  3. Deploy each changed service independently with `railway up <service-path> --path-as-root --service <service-id> --project <project-id> --environment production --ci`.
  4. Store deploy credentials and identifiers in GitHub secrets (`RAILWAY_TOKEN`, `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`, `RAILWAY_BACKEND_SERVICE_ID`, `RAILWAY_FRONTEND_SERVICE_ID`).
- Consequences: Pushes to `main` now trigger automatic Railway deployments while avoiding unnecessary redeploys for untouched services; shared-path changes still redeploy both services by design.

## 2026-04-10 13:30:00 EDT — Make regeneration structure deterministic, cap non-admin full regenerations, and move generation to slower higher-quality defaults

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Full and section regeneration occasionally returned Professional Experience output that dropped or altered company/date lines, creating structural drift that deterministic validation could miss when model output was inconsistent. The team also needed longer async windows for slower higher-quality models and explicit cost controls for repeated full regenerations.
- Decision:
  1. Add deterministic Professional Experience source anchors (`title`, `company`, `date_range`, source order) extracted from sanitized base resume content and pass them into full and section regeneration prompts as explicit invariants.
  2. Add a deterministic post-LLM normalization pass that rehydrates Professional Experience company/date from source anchors before validation and assembly; low/medium also force source-exact titles while high preserves generated titles only when company/date stay source-exact.
  3. Strengthen deterministic validation to fail closed when Professional Experience role blocks cannot satisfy the structure contract after normalization.
  4. Enforce a hard per-application cap of three full regenerations for non-admin users, consume a slot only when queueing succeeds, and allow admin bypass.
  5. Increase generation timeout profiles to `240s` full generation/full regeneration and `120s` section regeneration, and surface section-aware stage messages through progress updates.
  6. Set generation model defaults to `z-ai/glm-5.1` primary and `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` fallback, while leaving extraction defaults unchanged.
- Consequences: Regeneration output stays structurally stable for Professional Experience across retries, user-facing progress becomes clearer for longer-running models, full-regeneration spend is bounded for non-admin users, and admin workflows retain operational override capability.

## 2026-04-10 10:42:00 EDT — Keep onboarding invite-only via tokenized signup, and scope admin to metrics plus user lifecycle controls

- Status: Accepted
- Context: The product needed account creation for new users without opening public registration. Admin users also needed operational visibility and user lifecycle controls before launch, with reliable invite delivery through Resend and clear onboarding requirements.
- Decision:
  1. Keep signup invite-only by introducing tokenized invite links and dedicated unauthenticated invite preview/accept endpoints, while keeping all other application APIs JWT-protected.
  2. Pre-provision invited users in Supabase Auth at invite-send time, then complete onboarding on invite acceptance by setting password and mandatory profile fields.
  3. Require invite-signup profile fields `first_name`, `last_name`, `location`, `phone`, and `email`; keep LinkedIn optional.
  4. Enforce password confirmation and a minimum password policy of 12+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, number, and symbol.
  5. Scope admin MVP responsibilities to exactly two surfaces: a metrics dashboard (invite funnel plus extraction/generation/regeneration/export outcomes) and user management (invite, edit, deactivate/reactivate, delete).
- Consequences: The app remains private and invite-gated, onboarding becomes deterministic and auditable, and admins can operate user access and monitor core workflow health without adding non-actionable vanity analytics.

## 2026-04-09 20:56:55 EDT — Add semantic job-location extraction separate from compensation

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Live testing against an Accenture posting showed that a single rendered line could contain both location text and salary text, which caused `compensation_text` to absorb location data when extraction treated the line as one compensation snippet. The product also needed users to be able to review and edit location separately in the application detail workspace.
- Decision:
  1. Add a nullable `applications.job_location_text` field that stores raw location or hiring-region text exactly as shown in the posting or manual entry.
  2. Keep the separation between `job_location_text` and `compensation_text` model-driven: extraction should use labels, surrounding context, and page meaning rather than brittle deterministic splitting rules.
  3. Leave `job_location_text` or `compensation_text` null when the page does not support a clear distinction, instead of forcing a guess.
  4. Expose `job_location_text` in manual entry and the application detail Job Information card, but keep duplicate-review behavior unchanged when only that field changes.
- Consequences: Accenture-style postings where location and salary share a line can still produce clean structured fields, the schema remains additive and backward compatible, and the extraction contract stays robust across employers that render location and compensation differently.

## 2026-04-09 20:18:29 EDT — Keep export header profile-driven, add LinkedIn explicitly, and let PDF export tighten to the saved page target

- Status: Accepted
- Context: PDF export was rendering a second header on top of the assembled Markdown header, existing drafts could still contain the legacy `# (Name)` placeholder block, and the profile contract had no first-class LinkedIn field even though the desired resume format required one. Export also ignored the saved `page_length` target, so the final PDF page count could drift more than necessary from the user’s configured length.
- Decision:
  1. Keep the user profile as the single source of truth for export header data and add `profiles.linkedin_url` as an additive nullable field.
  2. Continue storing `profiles.address`, but treat it as the short location line shown in resume assembly and export rather than a mailing-address-specific requirement.
  3. Remove the export-time duplicate-header prepend and normalize only known legacy or assembly-style header blocks during export so broken drafts recover without forcing regeneration.
  4. Require a non-blank profile `name` before initial generation, full regeneration, and PDF export, with actionable fail-closed errors instead of emitting the `# (Name)` placeholder.
  5. Read the saved draft `generation_params.page_length` during export and retry progressively tighter layout presets until the PDF fits the target page count or the minimum preset is reached.
- Consequences: Exported PDFs now stay closer to the intended reference format, profile-managed contact fields remain outside the model boundary, old broken drafts recover on export, and users get clearer recovery guidance when mandatory profile data is missing.

## 2026-04-09 20:22:31 EDT — Make new-application intake modal-based and allow optional pasted-text creation from the applications page

- Status: Accepted
- Context: The applications page still created new applications through an inline top-of-page card that accepted only a URL, while the better-looking modal intake the product needed also had to support the already-available pasted-text extraction path without forcing users through a failure-recovery detour first.
- Decision:
  1. Replace the inline applications-page intake card with a dedicated modal that matches the existing spruce/ink/ember visual language.
  2. Keep the modal URL-first: the job URL is always required and visible when the modal opens.
  3. Reveal the pasted job-description textarea only after the user explicitly clicks the secondary paste option, rather than showing it by default.
  4. Extend `POST /api/applications` so the applications page can create directly from `{ job_url, source_text }`, reusing the existing capture-backed extraction path instead of inventing a separate intake workflow.
- Consequences: New-application intake becomes more intentional and visually polished, pasted source text can improve extraction from the first submit instead of only during recovery, the database contract remains unchanged because `job_url` stays required, and the PRD plus roadmap now need to describe the dashboard flow as URL-first rather than URL-only.

## 2026-04-09 20:00:24 EDT — Allow high-only professional-experience title rewrites while keeping low and medium title-fixed

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Users wanted the highest aggressiveness setting to go beyond bullet reframing and allow professional-experience role titles to be rewritten for target-role alignment. The existing prompt contract, validator, and agent guidance treated any rewritten job title as unsupported hallucination, so the feature could not work without a coordinated rules change.
- Decision:
  1. Keep low and medium aggressiveness title-fixed: Professional Experience role titles must remain exactly as they appear in the source resume.
  2. Allow high aggressiveness to retitle Professional Experience role names only when the new title is a truthful reframing of the same source role.
  3. Preserve employer and dates exactly when role titles are rewritten, and explicitly forbid seniority inflation or invented scope through the prompt contract.
  4. Update deterministic validation so the high-aggressiveness carveout applies only to Professional Experience role-title claims; employers, dates, credentials, and other unsupported claims remain blocked.
- Consequences: High aggressiveness becomes materially more assertive for experience positioning, low and medium remain conservative, and the validator still fail-closes on invented employers, dates, credentials, or broader hallucinations.

## 2026-04-09 19:36:58 EDT — Store full posting bodies, add raw compensation text, and keep aggressiveness help compact

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Extraction was stopping at partial job-description content on some postings, which caused lower-page sections like qualifications and compensation to be dropped. The application detail page also exposed low, medium, and high aggressiveness settings without clearly showing which sections each level rewrites.
- Decision:
  1. Treat `applications.job_description` as the full primary posting body rather than a narrowed duties excerpt, and preserve more captured page text so lower-page sections remain available to extraction.
  2. Add a nullable `applications.compensation_text` field that stores raw compensation text exactly as shown in the posting or manual entry, without attempting MVP normalization into min/max or currency fields.
  3. Prefer main-content extraction targets (`main`, `article`, `[role="main"]`) before falling back to the page body, while still excluding obvious page chrome and blocked-page noise.
  4. Keep the Generation Settings card compact and expose the complete low, medium, and high behavior contract through inline popovers instead of permanently expanded copy.
- Consequences: Existing rows remain compatible without backfill, extraction gets better coverage of full postings, compensation becomes reviewable and user-editable in the detail workspace, and aggressiveness choices become clearer without making the settings rail materially taller.

## 2026-04-08 12:55:00 EDT — Make resume prompts operational, enable generation-only reasoning, and surface low-confidence upload cleanup

- Status: Accepted
- Context: The single-call generation pipeline had the right grounding and privacy posture, but the prompts were still underspecified for resume-writing quality, section-specific rewrite behavior, word-budget control, and adversarial user instructions. The upload cleanup path also had no way to signal when a badly parsed resume still needed manual review.
- Decision:
  1. Replace the prior generation prompt with a fixed five-block structure: role, non-negotiables, section rules, aggressiveness contract, and length contract.
  2. Treat the model as an expert ATS resume writer, explicitly require resume-writing best practices, forbid em dashes in model-authored resume content, and make aggressiveness section-specific: Summary and Professional Experience vary most, Skills varies by level, and Education stays fact-frozen.
  3. Replace vague page-count language with explicit word-budget targets and hard caps, plus section-level content budgets.
  4. Enable OpenRouter reasoning only for resume generation calls, using medium reasoning for initial full generation and high reasoning for full or section regeneration. Keep extraction and upload cleanup non-reasoning.
  5. Try structured output first for generation, but keep a strict prompt-level JSON contract and fall back locally when structured output or provider-specific reasoning support is not available.
  6. Add deterministic screening for unsafe user instructions that attempt to override grounding or inject new facts.
  7. Let upload cleanup return both cleaned Markdown and a minimal review-warning signal when the parsed resume still looks too degraded to trust automatically.
- Consequences: Resume prompts become more controllable and auditable, generation can spend extra reasoning budget only where quality matters most, prompt injection on user instructions is reduced before jobs start, and uploaded resumes can surface a review banner instead of silently feeding questionable parsed content into later generation steps.

## 2026-04-08 08:39:33 EDT — Move resume writing to single-call structured generation with local privacy and validation controls

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Resume generation had regressed into mediocre output, redundant OpenRouter calls, and prompt paths that could include user contact data. The existing architecture used multiple model calls to write sections and a separate model call to validate them, which increased cost and complexity while leaving privacy and async edge cases exposed.
- Decision:
  1. Use one OpenRouter call for each initial-generation, full-regeneration, or single-section-regeneration action, with the model returning strict JSON that the app splits and assembles locally.
  2. Remove personal and contact information from resume content before every external LLM call that touches resume text, and reattach the stripped header locally after deterministic validation or upload cleanup.
  3. Replace the separate validation model call with local schema and rule validation that checks section order, ATS-safety, contact leakage, grounding snippets, and unsupported date or claim drift.
  4. Allow a second model request only when the primary request fails at the provider or transport layer, or returns invalid structured output; user-requested regeneration remains the only normal user-initiated repeat path.
  5. Harden async generation callbacks with bounded callback retries, stale-job fencing, and frontend hydration of saved generation settings so retries and regenerations reuse the intended configuration.
- Consequences: Resume writing is cheaper and easier to reason about, PII stays inside the app boundary, validation becomes deterministic and fail-closed, and late or stale async updates can no longer overwrite terminal application state as easily.

## 2026-04-07 23:07:06 EDT — Treat full-generation timeouts as stalled-progress detection, not a blunt wall-clock cutoff

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Full resume generation could still be healthy after the original 90-second mark because sections complete independently, but the worker enforced a flat wall-clock timeout and the frontend kept polling forever when terminal progress could not be reconciled back into application detail.
- Decision:
  1. Keep section-level generation and validation calls individually bounded, but change full-generation timeout handling to a `90s` idle timeout with a `300s` maximum wall-clock cap.
  2. Let backend stalled-job recovery run from the polling progress endpoint so the frontend sees the terminal state directly even when a detail refresh is lagging or broken.
  3. Stop frontend generation polling once terminal progress is observed, using that terminal progress to exit the active state even if the final detail refresh fails.
- Consequences: Long-running but advancing generations get more time to finish, truly stalled jobs still fail closed, and the detail page cannot remain stuck in an infinite `progress -> detail refresh -> retry` loop after a generation timeout or failure.

## 2026-04-07 22:45:00 EDT — Separate ready-to-generate from actively-running generation and fence stale callbacks

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Applications were getting stuck in apparent generation progress because the worker callback payload shape diverged from the backend contract, the frontend treated every `generation_pending` row as actively running, and cancel or timeout recovery paths tried to write failure reasons the database enum did not allow.
- Decision:
  1. Reserve `generation_pending` for ready or retryable initial-generation states, and treat actively running generation as `generating` plus live non-terminal progress.
  2. Use nested `generated` and `failure` payloads for generation and regeneration worker callbacks so success and failure data match the backend models exactly.
  3. When cancelling or timing out a generation job, write terminal progress with a fresh synthetic job id so any late worker callback is ignored by the existing job-id fence.
  4. Extend `failure_reason_enum` with `generation_timeout` and `generation_cancelled` so cancel and timeout behavior remains explicit and schema-safe.
- Consequences: Failed or cancelled initial-generation rows stay retryable without masquerading as active jobs, stale callbacks cannot overwrite a cancelled or timed-out application, and the detail page can reliably switch from progress UI to failure or retry UI for both current and future applications.

## Phase 3 & 4: Generation, Editing, and Export (2026-04-07)

### Generation Architecture
- **Superseded on 2026-04-08**: The original section-based multi-call generation approach was replaced by single-call structured generation plus deterministic local validation and privacy sanitization.
- **Model fallback**: Primary model → fallback model on failure. Configured via GENERATION_AGENT_MODEL and GENERATION_AGENT_FALLBACK_MODEL env vars.
- **LangChain + OpenRouter**: Used ChatOpenAI from langchain-openai pointed at OpenRouter API base for model flexibility.

### Validation Pipeline
- **Hallucination detection**: LLM-based comparison of generated content against source resume to flag invented facts.
- **ATS-safety**: Rule-based checks (no tables, no images, clean Markdown).
- **Required sections + ordering**: Validates all enabled sections are present and correctly ordered.

### PDF Export
- **WeasyPrint**: Chosen for ATS-safe PDF output. Runs in thread pool with 20s timeout.
- **On-demand only**: No persistent PDF storage per PRD. Generated from latest draft content on each export request.
- **Deferred import**: WeasyPrint imported at call time to avoid breaking dev environments without native libs.

### Frontend Editing
- **Inline Markdown editor**: Edit/preview toggle in the draft card. Direct Markdown editing with save to backend.
- **react-markdown + remark-gfm**: For Markdown preview rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown support.

### Status Management
- After export, visible_status transitions to "complete".
- After edit or regeneration post-export, status returns to "in_progress".
- `applied` flag remains independently user-controlled throughout.

## 2026-04-07 17:30:00 EDT — Phase 2 — File Format and LLM Cleanup Decisions

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Phase 2 needed concrete decisions for resume file ingestion and optional LLM post-processing before the base resume management and profile surfaces could be implemented without leaving open design gaps.
- Decisions:
  1. PDF-only resume upload for MVP (using pdfplumber). .docx support deferred to reduce scope.
  2. Optional LLM cleanup pass via direct OpenRouter API call (httpx) rather than LangChain. LangChain integration deferred to Phase 3 generation pipeline.
  3. OpenRouter cleanup model defaults to openai/gpt-4o-mini with 30-second timeout. Cleanup failures are non-blocking — raw parsed Markdown is returned on any error.
- Rationale: Keep Phase 2 focused on data management and configuration setup. PDF is the most common resume format. Direct OpenRouter call avoids premature LangChain dependency.
- Consequences: The resume upload path now accepts only `.pdf` files, the backend makes a best-effort LLM cleanup call with graceful fallback, and Phase 3 will introduce LangChain for generation rather than retrofitting it into the upload pipeline.

## 2026-04-07 15:30:43 EDT — Add blocked-source recovery and Chrome extension intake as the Phase 1A follow-on

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Phase 1 left extraction failures recoverable through retry and manual entry, but hostile job sites can return block pages instead of postings, and the product needed a compliant way to ingest job content from a user-controlled browser session without introducing a separate extension sign-in flow.
- Decision: Detect blocked pages explicitly before LLM extraction, persist sanitized blocked-source diagnostics on the application, and route recovery through pasted-text retry first and manual entry second. Add a Chrome-only Manifest V3 extension that captures current-tab content, creates new applications through a token-protected import endpoint, and receives its scoped token from the authenticated web app rather than storing Supabase session credentials.
- Consequences: The schema now needs additive storage for `applications.extraction_failure_details` and revocable hashed extension tokens on `profiles`. The detail page becomes the blocked-source recovery surface, the worker must classify block pages deterministically, and extension imports stay inside the existing per-user ownership boundary without expanding the public auth surface.

## 2026-04-07 13:15:06 EDT — Lock the Phase 1 extraction and per-agent model configuration contract

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Phase 1 needed concrete extraction behavior and a stable environment-variable contract for multiple AI agents before the worker, backend callback flow, duplicate review, and frontend recovery states could be implemented without leaving open design gaps.
- Decision: Implement extraction as a hybrid pipeline that captures deterministic page context with Playwright, sends that context to an OpenRouter-backed extraction agent for structured output, and accepts automatic extraction only when `job_title` and `job_description` validate successfully. Keep `company` optional at extraction time, defer duplicate review until company exists, and score duplicates with additional URL, reference-id, origin, and description context instead of title-company similarity alone.
- Model-config decision: Use one shared `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` plus explicit primary and fallback model environment variables per agent. Phase 1 wires the extraction agent now and reserves the same pattern for generation, validation, and future agents.
- Consequences: The worker now owns Playwright capture plus LLM extraction, the backend keeps workflow state and duplicate decisions, extraction failure cleanly falls back to manual entry, and future AI agents can be added without reworking the model configuration surface.

## 2026-04-07 12:06:48 EDT — Simplify the local env contract and separate app email from local auth email

- Status: Accepted
- Context: The initial Phase 0 stack exposed duplicated frontend, backend, worker, and local GoTrue mailer variables through the root env file even though local development only needs a small user-edited surface. The product requirement for Resend applies to app notifications, not to self-hosted local Supabase Auth delivery.
- Decision: Make the root `.env.compose` contract canonical, collapse repeated runtime toggles into shared root values, disable local GoTrue email delivery in dev mode, and reserve app-level email configuration for `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `EMAIL_FROM`.
- Consequences: Local testing no longer depends on user-supplied SMTP or Mailpit variables, app email sending is explicitly gated in the backend, and developers only edit the reduced root env contract for normal Compose-based work.

## 2026-04-07 11:36:08 EDT — Lock Phase 0 foundation choices for implementation

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Phase 0 required concrete decisions for the local development stack, background job baseline, initial progress-delivery contract, and frontend auth persistence before code could be scaffolded without leaving major implementation gaps.
- Decision: Implement the local stack as a repo-owned Docker Compose workflow, use ARQ + Redis as the background job baseline, standardize initial progress delivery around polling, and persist frontend Supabase sessions in `sessionStorage` rather than `localStorage`.
- Consequences: The committed foundation now centers on a single root Compose + Makefile workflow, a runnable ARQ worker container, a shared polling-progress contract, and a frontend auth client that avoids browser `localStorage`. Future phases can add extraction and generation behavior without re-deciding the infrastructure baseline.

## 2026-04-07 10:00:16 EDT — Normalize job posting origin on applications

- Status: Accepted
- Context: Application intake previously relied on extracted or manually entered job title, company, and job description, while duplicate review compared only title and company. That left no structured way to record where a posting came from and made duplicate warnings less precise for postings that appear across multiple boards.
- Decision: Add a nullable normalized `job_posting_origin` field to applications, with fixed MVP values for common sources and a conditional free-text companion field when the user selects `Other`. Automatic extraction should classify the origin when confidence is sufficient; otherwise the user can provide or edit it later from manual entry or the application detail page.
- Duplicate-review rule: Consider `job_posting_origin` during duplicate evaluation when both compared applications have it populated, but do not require it. If origin is missing on either side, fall back to the existing title-and-company duplicate check.
- Consequences: The PRD, schema contract, migration runbook, and roadmap now treat posting origin as a first-class application field. Existing rows do not require a backfill and may remain `NULL` until a user or later tooling supplies the value.
