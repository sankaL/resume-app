- [] In the extraction some ex some sections are not being grabbed just a job to description. I want to grab the entire description in the job description. Example Accenture. Not just grab the job description part. I wante tod grab the qualifications everything about the j job also even grab the salary if it's provided I think that should be a new field as part of the application. We need to do a schema change. add add the things that will change in the configuration when the user is selecting low, medium, high so that they know exactly what is what will be affected If it's too much information to put, make the configuration card smaller with a tooltip that shows all the details. 
- [] In the aggressiveness high, I wanted to even change the professional experience titles. Not the dates of the titles, but the actual title name to change it to match whatever experience that I'm putting in. low and medium mode do not touch the titles of any of my roles Uh 
- [] Add a delete button in the applications table in the action column and add a delete button on the application details page Next to the export PDF button.
