INFERENCE_BOUNDARY_EXAMPLE = (

    "- Unacceptable medium rewrite: \"Engineering Manager\" when the source does not show people management.\n"
    "- Why: medium may improve role alignment, but the rewrite still has to stay in the same grounded role family and preserve seniority."

EXPERIENCE_REWRITE_EXAMPLE = (
    "Worked example of material Professional Experience tailoring inside fixed role order:\n"
    "- Source bullets: \"Built backend APIs.\" and \"Maintained CI/CD pipelines.\"\n"
    "- Acceptable medium rewrite: \"Built backend APIs and maintained CI/CD pipelines for internal platform services.\"\n"
    "- Acceptable high rewrite: \"Built backend APIs and maintained CI/CD pipelines for internal platform services, emphasizing deployment reliability and shared tooling.\"\n"
    "- Unacceptable rewrite: leave the first two roles' bullets effectively unchanged while moving all tailoring effort into Summary or Skills.\n"

VOICE_BOUNDARY_EXAMPLE = (
